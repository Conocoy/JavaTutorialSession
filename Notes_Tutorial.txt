Class names should start with an upper case, method names with a lower case, program file name should match the class name (is this true? maybe a convention)

Singleton example is good to see how singleton classes work, can be a powerful technique!

Inheritance acces control:
1) Methods declared pulic in a superclass must be public in subclasses
2) Methods declared protected must be declared protected or public
3) Methods declared without acces control can be more private
4) Methods declared private do not inherit

Enhanced for loops in java, same idea as the Python for x in l where l is a list. Example:

int[] numbers = [1,2,3]
for( int x : numbers){ System.out.println(x); }
results in

1
2
3

Floats in string:
example: System.out.println("pow(%.3f, %.3f) is %.3f%n),11.635,2.760, 874.008)
The %n is a platform independent newline character which corresponds to
System.getProperty("line.separator")
